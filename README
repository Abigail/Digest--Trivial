This is version 2009070801 of Digest::Trivial, an XS module doing trivial,
but fast mapping of strings to integer 0 .. 255.

You need a C compiler to be able to install the module using the classic
steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Alternatively, you can install binaries someone else compiled for you.

The development version can be retrieved from github:
